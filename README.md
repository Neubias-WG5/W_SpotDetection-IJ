# W_SpotDetection-IJ
This workflow detects spots in a 2D image by filtering the image by Laplacian of Gaussian (user defined radius) and detecting regional intensity minima (user defined noise tolerance).

## Integration with NEUBIAS web-based database of bioimage analysis tools 
This workflow is described in [www.biii.eu](www.biii.eu) in [http://biii.eu/spot-detection-imagej](http://biii.eu/spot-detection-imagej)
